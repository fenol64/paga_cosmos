# 🌐 P.A.G.A. – Signed Promise Generates Action

P.A.G.A. (Promessa assinada gera atitude) is a **decentralized civic engagement platform** that strengthens democracy by empowering citizens to monitor and validate political promises. By using Web3 technology and tokenized incentives, P.A.G.A. creates a new democratic layer: citizens not only vote but also verify and influence public decisions beyond election cycles.

## 🧭 Purpose

P.A.G.A. aims to restore trust in politics by giving the public **a real-time voice** and **a tangible reward** for civic participation. Citizens can monitor whether political promises are being fulfilled and receive token incentives in return.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- ✅ Encourage active monitoring of political actions by citizens
- ✅ Connect campaign promises to verifiable execution
- ✅ Promote transparency and civic responsibility
- ✅ Offer blockchain-based rewards usable in the local economy
- ✅ Introduce the **Trusted Politician Seal** to publicly certify accountability

### 📌 Main Layers

1. **User Interaction Layer**
   - Citizens (voters), politicians, and local businesses

2. **Frontend**
   - Built with **Next.js + Bootstrap**
   - Wallet authentication via cosmjs interchain

3. **Dashboard & API**
   - Developed with **go**
   - for event-driven interactions and data management

3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Deployed on **Cosmos SDK using CosmWasm**
   - Stores promises, token records, and user interactions immutably

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 🔐 **Login & Onboarding**: Users sign in via Web3 wallets.
2. 📝 **Promise Monitoring**: Citizens register updates and evidence about political promises.
3. 🤝 **Peer Validation**: The community upvotes and verifies contributions.
4. 🪙 **Token Rewards**: Tokens are distributed for accurate participation.

## 🌐 Web3 & Cosmos Integration

Built with **CosmWasm** smart contracts, P.A.G.A. runs on neutron blockchain, minimizing gas fees and ensuring control of protocol rules.

### 🔩 Key Technologies

- **Interchain communication (IBC)** for cross-chain functionality  
- **Keplr wallet** compatibility for authentication  
- **Token gating** to prevent misuse (non-transferable tokens for validation power)
